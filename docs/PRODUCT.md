# Product Definition

## What This App Is

Product 5000 is a lightweight idea management tool for solo product managers. It helps track, prioritize, and validate product ideas across multiple products.

## Who It's For

Solo PMs or small team leads who:
- Manage multiple products or features simultaneously
- Want a structured way to capture and prioritize ideas
- Care about validation over gut feeling
- Prefer simple tools that get out of the way

## Core Jobs-to-be-Done

1. **Capture ideas quickly** - When inspiration strikes, log it fast with just a name and problem statement
2. **Prioritize ruthlessly** - See impact vs ease, sort and filter to find high-value opportunities
3. **Track validation status** - Know which ideas are hunches vs validated hypotheses
4. **Spot funnel gaps** - See where ideas cluster in the funnel, identify neglected stages
5. **Kill ideas confidently** - Archive invalidated ideas without losing the learning

## What It Is NOT

- **Not a roadmap tool** - No timelines, no Gantt charts, no sprint planning
- **Not a collaboration platform** - Single user, no sharing, no comments
- **Not a research repository** - Evidence field is for notes, not full research docs
- **Not a feature spec tool** - Ideas are hypotheses, not detailed requirements
- **Not a customer feedback inbox** - Ideas come from PM synthesis, not raw feedback

## Success Metrics (for the tool itself)

- Time to log a new idea: < 10 seconds
- Time to find top priority ideas: < 5 seconds
- Zero friction to update an idea's status
- Never lose an idea once captured

## Anti-Goals

- Feature parity with Productboard, Aha!, or similar tools
- Team collaboration features
- Integrations with other tools
- Mobile app (responsive web is fine)
- Offline support
